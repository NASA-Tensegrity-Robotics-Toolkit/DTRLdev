	lasers(4), photonic chips(5), nonlinear optics(6) and quantum information
	processing(7). Critical for these applications is the realization
	of a cavity with both high quality factor, Q, and small modal volume,
	V. The ratio Q/V determines the strength of the various cavity interactions,
	and an ultra-small cavity enables large-scale integration and single-mode
	operation for a broad range of wavelengths. However, a high-Q cavity
	of optical wavelength size is difficult to fabricate, as radiation
	loss increases in inverse proportion to cavity size. With the exception
	of a few recent theoretical studies(8-10), definitive theories and
	experiments for creating high-Q nanocavities have not been extensively
	investigated. Here we use a silicon-based two-dimensional photonic-crystal
	slab to fabricate a nanocavity with Q = 45,000 and V = 7.0 x 10(-14)
	cm(3); the value of Q/V is 10-100 times larger than in previous studies(4,11

	and fishes' tail-powered swimming? Why do horses change gait as they
	increase speed? What determines our own vertical leap? Recent technical
	advances have greatly increased researchers' ability to answer these
	questions with certainty and in detail. This text provides an up-to-date
	overview of how animals run, walk, jump, crawl, swim, soar, hover,
	and fly. Excluding only the tiny creatures that use cilia, it covers
	all animals that power their movements with muscle-from roundworms
	to whales, clams to elephants, and gnats to albatrosses. The introduction
	sets out the general rules governing all modes of animal locomotion
	and considers the performance criteria-such as speed, endurance,
	and economy-that have shaped their selection. It introduces energetics
	and optimality as basic principles. The text then tackles each of
	the major modes by which animals move on land, in water, and through
	air. It explains the mechanisms involved and the physical and biological
	forces shaping those mechanisms, paying particular attention to energy
	costs. Focusing on general principles but extensively discussing
	a wide variety of individual cases, this is a superb synthesis of
	current knowledge about animal locomotion. It will be enormously

	Reservoir Computing is a technique which enables a system to learn
	any time-invariant filter of the input by training a simple linear

	Interactive training appeared to accelerate the recovery of locomotion
	and maintain smooth locomotor movements. Despite the obvious loss
	of voluntary control and equilibrium which the experimenter partially
	compensated for by maintaining the thorax and/or the tail, the cats
	could walk with a regular rhythm and a well-coordinated hindlimb
	alternation at speeds of 0.1-1.2 m/s. Cycle duration as well as stance
	and swing duration resembled those of normal cats at comparable speeds.
	The range of angular motion was also similar to that observed in
	intact cats as was the coupling between different joints. The EMG
	activity of the hindlimb and lumbar axial muscles also retained the
	characteristics observed in the intact animal. Some deficits such
	as a dragging of the foot in early swing and diminution of the angular
	excursion in the knee were seen at later stages. Thus, the adult

  abstract = {This book provides a clear foundation, based on physical biology and
	biomechanics, for understanding the underlying mechanisms by which
	animals have evolved to move in their physical environment. It integrates
	the biomechanics of animal movement with the physiology of animal
	energetics and the neural control of locomotion. The author also
	communicates a sense of the awe and fascination that comes from watching
	the grace, speed, and power of animals in motion. Movement is a fundamental
	distinguishing feature of animal life, and a variety of extremely
	effective mechanical and physiological designs have evolved. Common
	themes are observed for the ways in which animals successfully contend
	with the properties of a given physical environment across diversity
	of life forms and varying locomotor modes. Understanding the common
	principles of design that span a diverse array of animals requires
	a broad comparative and integrative approach to their study. This
	theme persists throughout the book, as various modes and mechanisms
	of animal locomotion are covered. Since an animal's size is equally
	critical to its functional design, the effects of scale on locomotor
	energetics and mechanics are also discussed. Biewener begins by examining
	the underlying machinery for movement: skeletal muscles used for
	force generation, skeletons used for force transmission, and spring-like
	elements used for energy savings. He then describes the basic mechanisms
	that animals have evolved to move over land, in and on the surface
	of the water, and in the air. Common fluid dynamic principles are
	discussed as background to both swimming and flight. In addition
	to discussing the locomotor mechanisms of complex animals, the locomotor
	movement of single cells is also covered. Common biochemical features
	of cellular metabolism are then reviewed before discussing the energetic
	aspects of various locomotor modes. Strategies for conserving energy
	and moving economically are again highlighted in this section of
	the book. Emphasis is placed on comparisons of energetic features
	across locomotor modes. The book concludes with a discussion of the
	neural control of animal locomotion. The basic neurosensory and motor
	elements common to vertebrates and arthropods are discussed, and
	features of sensori-motor organization and function are highlighted.
	These are then examined in the context of specific examples of how
	animals control the rhythmic patterns of limb and body movement that
	underlie locomotor function and stability.},

	work has shown that such training with noise is equivalent to a form
	of regularization in which an extra term is added to the error function.
	However, the regularization term, which involves second derivatives
	of the error function, is not bounded below, and so can lead to difficulties
	if used directly in a learning algorithm based on error minimization.
	In this paper we show that, for the purposes of network training,
	the regularization term can be reduced to a positive definite form
	which involves only first derivatives of the network mapping. For
	a sum-of-squares error function, the regularization term belongs
	to the class of generalized Tikhonov regularizers. Direct minimization
	of the regularized error function provides a practical alternative
	to training with noise.},

	a benefit to the acquisition of robust behavior in machines. Here
	I show that in evolving populations of simulated robots, if robots
	grow from anguilliform into legged robots during their lifetime in
	the early stages of evolution, and the anguilliform body plan is
	gradually lost during later stages of evolution, gaits are evolved
	for the final, legged form of the robot more rapidly--and the evolved
	gaits are more robust--compared to evolving populations of legged
	robots that do not transition through the anguilliform body plan.
	This suggests that morphological change, as well as the evolution
	of development, are two important processes that improve the automatic
	generation of robust behaviors for machines. It also provides an
	experimental platform for investigating the relationship between
	the evolution of development and robust behavior in biological organisms.},

	come a host of ethical problems, as we wrestle with the implications
	of Asimov's laws of robotics and with the very real possibility that
	we have created a new kind of slave. There's no way of getting around
	this future, it would seem, and, adds Brooks, our species will change

  abstract = {VODE is a new initial value ODE solver for stiff and nonstiff systems.
	It uses variablecoefficient Adams-Moulton and Backward Differentiation
	Formula (BDF) methods in Nordsieck form, as taken from the older
	solvers EPISODE and EPISODEB, treating the Jacobian as full or banded.
	Unlike the older codes, VODE has a highly flexible user interface
	that is nearly identical to that of the ODEPACK solver LSODE. In
	the process, several algorithmic improvements have been made in VODE,
	aside from the new user interface. First, a change in stepsize and/or
	order that is decided upon at the end of one successful step is not
	implemented until the start of the next step, so that interpolations
	performed between steps use the more correct data. Second, a new
	algorithm for setting the initial stepsize has been included, which
	iterates briefly to estimate the required second derivative vector.
	Efficiency is often greatly enhanced by an added algorithm for saving
	and reusing the Jacobian matrix J, as it occurs in the Newton matrix,
	under certain conditions. As an option, this Jacobian-saving feature
	can be suppressed if the required extra storage is prohibitive. Finally,
	the modified Newton iteration is relaxed by a scalar factor in the
	stiff case, as a partial correction for the fact that the scalar
	coefficient in the Newton matrix may be out of date. The fixed-leading-coefficient
	form of the BDF methods has been studied independently, and a version
	ofVODE that incorporates it has been developed. This version does
	show better performance on some problems, but further tuning and
	testing are needed to make a final evaluation of it. Like its predecessors,
	VODE demonstrates that multistep methods with fully variable stepsizes
	and coefficients can outperform fixed-step-interpolatory methods
	on problems with widely different active time scales. In one comparison
	test, on a one-dimensional diurnal kinetics-transport problem with
	a banded internal Jacobian, the run time for VODE was 36 percent
	lower than that of LSODE without the J-saving algorithm and 49 percent
	lower with it. The fixed-leading-coefficient version ran slightly
	faster, by another 12 percent without J-saving and 5 percent with
	it. All of the runs achieved about the same accuracy.},

  abstract = {Single electrode recording in the inferotemporal cortex of monkeys
	during delayed visual memory tasks provide evidence for attractor
	dynamics in the observed region. The persistent elevated delay activities
	could be internal representations of features of the learned visual
	stimuli shown to the monkey during training. When uncorrelated stimuli
	are presented during training in a fixed sequence, these experiments
	display significant correlations between the internal representations.
	Recently a simple model of attractor neural network has reproduced
	quantitatively the measured correlations. An underlying assumption
	of the model is that the synaptic matrix formed during the training
	phase contains in its efficacies information about the contiguity
	of persistent stimuli in the training sequence. We present here a
	simple unsupervised learning dynamics that produces such a synaptic
	matrix if sequences of stimuli are repeatedly presented to the network
	at fixed order. The resulting matrix is then shown to convert temporal
	correlations during training into spatial correlations between attractors.
	The scenario is that, in the presence of selective delay activity,
	at the presentation of each stimulus, the activity distribution in
	the neural assembly contain information of both the current stimulus
	and the previous one (carried by the attractor). Thus the recurrent
	synaptic matrix can code not only for each of the stimuli presented
	to the network but also for their context. We combine the idea that
	for learning to be effective, synaptic modification should be stochastic,
	with the fact that attractors provide learnable information about
	two consecutive stimuli. We calculate explicitly the probability
	distribution of synaptic efficacies as a function of training protocol,
	that is, the order in which stimuli are presented to the network.
	We then solve for the dynamics of a network composed of integrate-and-fire
	excitatory and inhibitory neurons with a matrix of synaptic collaterals
	resulting from the learning dynamics. The network has a stable spontaneous
	activity, and stable delay activity develops after a critical learning
	stage. The availability of a learning dynamics makes possible a number
	of experimental predictions for the dependence of the delay activity
	distributions and the correlations between them, on the learning
	stage and the learning protocol. In particular it makes specific
	predictions for pair-associates delay experiments.},

  abstract = {Reservoir computing (RC) systems are powerful models for online computations
	on input sequences. They consist of a memoryless readout neuron that
	is trained on top of a randomly connected recurrent neural network.
	RC systems are commonly used in two flavors: with analog or binary
	(spiking) neurons in the recurrent circuits. Previous work indicated
	a fundamental difference in the behavior of these two implementations
	of the RC idea. The performance of an RC system built from binary
	neurons seems to depend strongly on the network connectivity structure.
	In networks of analog neurons, such clear dependency has not been
	observed. In this letter, we address this apparent dichotomy by investigating
	the influence of the network connectivity (parameterized by the neuron
	in-degree) on a family of network models that interpolates between
	analog and binary networks. Our analyses are based on a novel estimation
	of the Lyapunov exponent of the network dynamics with the help of
	branching process theory, rank measures that estimate the kernel
	quality and generalization capabilities of recurrent networks, and
	a novel mean field predictor for computational performance. These
	analyses reveal that the phase transition between ordered and chaotic
	network behavior of binary circuits qualitatively differs from the
	one in analog circuits, leading to differences in the integration
	of information over short and long timescales. This explains the
	decreased computational performance observed in binary circuits that
	are densely connected. The mean field predictor is also used to bound
	the memory function of recurrent circuits of binary neurons.},

	the robot body and its controller as two separate units, but by taking
	into account the interaction of the body with its environment. By
	investigating the impact of the body on the overall control-computation,
	it has been suggested that the body is effectively performing computations,
	leading to the term Morphological Computation. Recent work has linked
	this to the field of Reservoir Computing, allowing to endow morphologies
	with a theory of universal computation. In this work, we study a
	family of highly dynamic body structures, specifically tensegrity
	structures, controlled by one of the simplest kinds of "brains".
	These structures can be used to model biomechanical systems at different
	scales. By analyzing this extreme instantiation of compliant structures,
	we demonstrate the existence of a spectrum of choices on how to implement
	control in the body-brain composite. We show that tensegrity structures
	can maintain complex gaits with linear feedback control and that
	external feedback can intrinsically be integrated in the control
	loop. The various linear learning rules we consider, differ in biological
	plausibility and no specific assumptions are made on how to implement
	the feedback in a physical system.},

These tools, along with new control methodologies and the modular hardware components developed to validate them, are presented as a system for the design of actuated tensegrity structures. As evidenced from their appearance in many biological systems, tensegrity ('tensile¿integrity') structures have unique physical properties that make them ideal for interaction with uncertain environments. Yet, these characteristics make design and control of bioinspired tensegrity robots extremely challenging. This work presents the progress our tools have made in tackling the design and control challenges of spherical tensegrity structures. We focus on this shape since it lends itself to rolling locomotion. The results of our analyses include multiple novel control approaches for mobility and terrain interaction of spherical tensegrity structures that have been tested in simulation. A hardware prototype of a spherical six-bar tensegrity, the Reservoir Compliant Tensegrity Robot, is used to empirically validate the accuracy of simulation.},

	model composed of six rigid bars connected to a continuous network
	of 24 viscoelastic pre-stretched cables (Voigt bodies) in order to
	analyse the role of the cytoskeleton spatial rearrangement on the
	viscoelastic response of living adherent cells. This structural contribution
	was determined from the relationships between the global viscoelastic
	properties of the tensegrity model, i.e., normalized viscosity modulus
	(eta(*)), normalized elasticity modulus (E(*)), and the physical
	properties of the constitutive elements, i.e., their normalized length
	(L(*)) and normalized initial internal tension (T(*)). We used a
	numerical method to simulate the deformation of the structure in
	response to different types of loading, while varying by several
	orders of magnitude L(*) and T(*). The numerical results obtained
	reveal that eta(*) remains almost independent of changes in T(*)
	(eta(*) proportional, variant T(*+0.1)), whereas E(*) increases with
	approximately the square root of the internal tension T(*) (from
	E(*) proportional, variant T(*+0.3) to E(*) proportional, variant
	T(*+0.7)). Moreover, structural viscosity eta(*) and elasticity E(*)
	are both inversely proportional to the square of the size of the
	structure (eta(*) proportional, variant L(*-2) and E(*) proportional,
	variant L(*-2)). These structural properties appear consistent with
	cytoskeleton (CSK) mechanical properties measured experimentally
	by various methods which are specific to the CSK micromanipulation
	in living adherent cells. Present results suggest, for the first
	time, that the effect of structural rearrangement of CSK elements
	on global CSK behavior is characterized by a faster cellular mechanical
	response relatively to the CSK element response, which thus contributes
	to the solidification process observed in adherent cells. In extending
	to the viscoelastic properties the analysis of the mechanical response
	of the cellular 30-element tensegrity model, the present study contributes
	to the understanding of recent results on the cellular-dynamic response
	and allows to reunify the scattered data reported for the viscoelastic
	properties of living adherent cells.},

  abstract = {Tensegrity, a coined word describing a structure that retains its
	integrity under tension, is a concept developed by the American sculptor,
	Kenneth Snelson. The wonder and beauty of Snelson's sculptures surely
	lie in their three-dimensional nature. But these assemblies also
	pose interesting and difficult questions for mathematicians. Mathematically,
	what is a tensgrity? Why is it stable? Can tensegrities be classified
	or listed? The authors' recent work has aimed to find a proper three-dimensional
	generalization for tensegrities. Using the mathematical tools of
	group theory and representation theory, coupled with the powerful
	graphic and computational capabilities of computers, they have drawn
	up a complete catalogue of tensegrities with certain prescribed types
	of stability and symmetry, including some that have never been seen
	before.},

	This is bounded by the number of linearly independent state variables

	independent functions of its stimuli the system can compute. Our

	system modeling, stochastic processes, and functional analysis. We
	illustrate our theory by numerical simulations for the logistic map,

	302 neurons, and their pattern of synaptic connectivity is known.
	With only five olfactory neurons, C. elegans can dynamically respond

	enable the nematode to remember its cultivation temperature and to
	track narrow isotherms. Polymodal sensory neurons detect a wide range
	of nociceptive cues and signal robust escape responses. Pairing of
	sensory stimuli leads to long-lived changes in behavior consistent
	with associative learning. Worms exhibit social behaviors and complex
	ultradian rhythms driven by Ca(2+) oscillators with clock-like properties.
	Genetic analysis has identified gene products required for nervous

	when there is a closed form relationship between the response required
	and the control parameter. Building on a previous study of an adjustable
	structure, this paper describes geometric active control of a reusable
	tensegrity structure that has been enlarged to five modules with
	improved connections and is equipped with actuators. Closely coupled
	strut and cable elements behave nonlinearly (geometrically) even
	for small movement of the 10 telescopic struts. The control criterion
	for maintaining the upper surface slope has no closed form relationship
	with strut movement. The behavior of the structure is studied under
	25 load cases. A newly developed stochastic search algorithm successfully
	identifies good control commands following computation times of up
	to 1 h. Sequential application of the commands through sets of partial
	commands helps to avoid exceeding limits during intermediate stages
	and adds robustness to the system. Reuse of a previously calculated
	command reduces the response time to less than 1 min. Feasible storage
	and reuse of such commands confirm the potential for improving performance

  abstract = {If one formulates Helmholtz's ideas about perception in terms of modern-day
	theories one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning
	that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts. Using
	constructs from statistical physics it can be shown that the problems
	of inferring what cause our sensory input and learning causal regularities
	in the sensorium can be resolved using exactly the same principles.
	Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically
	plausible fashion. The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and
	hierarchical models of how sensory information is generated. The
	use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations
	in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides
	a principled way to understand many aspects of the brain's organisation
	and responses.In this paper, we suggest that these perceptual processes
	are just one emergent property of systems that conform to a free-energy
	principle. The free-energy considered here represents a bound on
	the surprise inherent in any exchange with the environment, under
	expectations encoded by its state or configuration. A system can
	minimise free-energy by changing its configuration to change the
	way it samples the environment, or to change its expectations. These
	changes correspond to action and perception respectively and lead
	to an adaptive exchange with the environment that is characteristic
	of biological systems. This treatment implies that the system's state
	and structure encode an implicit and probabilistic model of the environment.
	We will look at models entailed by the brain and how minimisation
	of free-energy can explain its dynamics and structure.},

  abstract = {To perform nontrivial, real-time computations on a sensory input stream,
	biological systems must retain a short-term memory trace of their
	recent inputs. It has been proposed that generic high-dimensional
	dynamical systems could retain a memory trace for past inputs in
	their current state. This raises important questions about the fundamental
	limits of such memory traces and the properties required of dynamical
	systems to achieve these limits. We address these issues by applying
	Fisher information theory to dynamical systems driven by time-dependent
	signals corrupted by noise. We introduce the Fisher Memory Curve
	(FMC) as a measure of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) embedded in
	the dynamical state relative to the input SNR. The integrated FMC
	indicates the total memory capacity. We apply this theory to linear
	neuronal networks and show that the capacity of networks with normal
	connectivity matrices is exactly 1 and that of any network of N neurons
	is, at most, N. A nonnormal network achieving this bound is subject
	to stringent design constraints: It must have a hidden feedforward
	architecture that superlinearly amplifies its input for a time of
	order N, and the input connectivity must optimally match this architecture.
	The memory capacity of networks subject to saturating nonlinearities
	is further limited, and cannot exceed . This limit can be realized
	by feedforward structures with divergent fan out that distributes
	the signal across neurons, thereby avoiding saturation. We illustrate
	the generality of the theory by showing that memory in fluid systems
	can be sustained by transient nonnormal amplification due to convective
	instability or the onset of turbulence.},

  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
	and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data
	in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.
	The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development
	of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such
	as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these
	tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
	terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas
	in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical,
	the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples
	are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable
	resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in
	science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised
	learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include
	neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
	boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any
	book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in
	the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble
	methods, least angle regression path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative
	matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter
	on methods for wide data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing
	and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and
	Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University.
	They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani
	developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of
	that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling
	software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves
	and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the
	very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the
	co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection
	pursuit and gradient boosting.},

	complex dynamics, inherently difficult. The vision of morphological
	computation proposes to view these aspects not only as problems,
	but rather also as parts of the solution. Non-rigid body parts are
	not seen anymore as imperfect realizations of rigid body parts, but
	rather as potential computational resources. The applicability of
	this vision has already been demonstrated for a variety of complex
	robot control problems. Nevertheless, a theoretical basis for understanding
	the capabilities and limitations of morphological computation has
	been missing so far. We present a model for morphological computation
	with compliant bodies, where a precise mathematical characterization
	of the potential computational contribution of a complex physical
	body is feasible. The theory suggests that complexity and nonlinearity,
	typically unwanted properties of robots, are desired features in
	order to provide computational power. We demonstrate that simple
	generic models of physical bodies, based on mass-spring systems,
	can be used to implement complex nonlinear operators. By adding a
	simple readout (which is static and linear) to the morphology such
	devices are able to emulate complex mappings of input to output streams
	in continuous time. Hence, by outsourcing parts of the computation
	to the physical body, the difficult problem of learning to control
	a complex body, could be reduced to a simple and perspicuous learning
	task, which can not get stuck in local minima of an error function.},

	with a single trained linear readout layer. Despite the untrained
	nature of the recurrent weights, they are capable of performing universal
	computations on temporal input data, which makes them interesting
	for both theoretical research and practical applications. The key
	to their success lies in the fact that the network computes a broad
	set of nonlinear, spatiotemporal mappings of the input data, on which
	linear regression or classification can easily be performed. One
	could consider the reservoir as a spatiotemporal kernel, in which
	the mapping to a high-dimensional space is computed explicitly. In
	this letter, we build on this idea and extend the concept of ESNs
	to infinite-sized recurrent neural networks, which can be considered
	recursive kernels that subsequently can be used to create recursive
	support vector machines. We present the theoretical framework, provide
	several practical examples of recursive kernels, and apply them to
	typical temporal tasks.},

  abstract = {Reservoir Computing is a novel technique which employs recurrent neural
	networks while circumventing difficult training algorithms. A very
	recent trend in Reservoir Computing is the use of real physical dynamical
	systems as implementation platforms, rather than the customary digital
	emulations. Physical systems operate in continuous time, creating
	a fundamental difference with the classic discrete time definitions
	of Reservoir Computing. The specific goal of this paper is to study
	the memory properties of such systems, where we will limit ourselves
	to linear dynamics. We develop an analytical model which allows the
	calculation of the memory function for continuous time linear dynamical
	systems, which can be considered as networks of linear leaky integrator
	neurons. We then use this model to research memory properties for
	different types of reservoir. We start with random connection matrices
	with a shifted eigenvalue spectrum, which perform very poorly. Next,
	we transform two specific reservoir types, which are known to give
	good performance in discrete time, to the continuous time domain.
	Reservoirs based on uniform spreading of connection matrix eigenvalues
	on the unit disk in discrete time give much better memory properties
	than reservoirs with random connection matrices, where reservoirs
	based on orthogonal connection matrices in discrete time are very
	robust against noise and their memory properties can be tuned. The
	overall results found in this work yield important insights into
	how to design networks for continuous time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	research carried out on locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs),

	with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models
	implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators
	can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated
	robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific
	tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological
	CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific
	modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I
	will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of
	using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as

	This review attempts to place the potential molecular mediators of
	mechanotransduction (e.g. stretch-sensitive ion channels, signaling
	molecules, cytoskeleton, integrins) within the context of the structural
	complexity of living cells. The model presented relies on recent
	experimental findings, which suggests that cells use tensegrity architecture
	for their organization. Tensegrity predicts that cells are hard-wired
	to respond immediately to mechanical stresses transmitted over cell
	surface receptors that physically couple the cytoskeleton to extracellular
	matrix (e.g. integrins) or to other cells (cadherins, selectins,
	CAMs). Many signal transducing molecules that are activated by cell
	binding to growth factors and extracellular matrix associate with
	cytoskeletal scaffolds within focal adhesion complexes. Mechanical
	signals, therefore, may be integrated with other environmental signals
	and transduced into a biochemical response through force-dependent
	changes in scaffold geometry or molecular mechanics. Tensegrity also
	provides a mechanism to focus mechanical energy on molecular transducers
	and to orchestrate and tune the cellular response.},

  abstract = {The Kalman Filter(KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking
	and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and
	robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems
	can be diffcult. The most common approach is to use the Extended
	Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearises all nonlinear models
	so that the traditional linear Kalman Filter can be applied. Although
	the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy,
	over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus
	within the tracking and control community that it is diffcult to
	implement, diffcult to tune, and only reliable for systems which
	are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this
	paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using
	the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used
	to parameterise mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance
	equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalises elegantly
	to nonlinear systems without the linearisation steps required by
	the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the
	new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly
	comparable to that of the second order Gauss Filter. The method is
	not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources
	are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate
	estimation features of the new lter recommend its use over the EKF
	in virtually all applications.},

	images at speeds greater than 800 frames/s. Using this system, we
	discovered that, during rapid swimming of Giardia trophozoites, undulations
	of the caudal region contributed to forward propulsion combined with
	the beating of the flagella pairs. It was also discovered, in contrast
	to previous studies with 10 times slower image sampling technique,
	that the anterior and posterolateral flagella beat with a clearly
	defined power stroke and not symmetrical undulations. During the
	transition from free swimming to attachment, trophozoites modified
	their swimming behavior from a rapid rotating motion to a more stable
	planar swimming. While using this planar swimming motion, the trophozoites
	used the flagella for propulsion and directional control. In addition
	to examination of the posterolateral and anterior flagella, a model
	to describe the motion of the ventral flagella was derived, indicating
	that the ventral flagella beat in an expanding sine wave. In addition,
	the structure of the ventrocaudal groove creates boundary conditions
	that determine the form of beating of the ventral flagella. The results
	from this study indicate that Giardia is able to simultaneously generate
	both ciliary beating and typical eukaryotic flagellar beating using

	on prior work by Jaeger and by Rivest and Schapire, in this paper
	we compare and contrast a linear specialization of the predictive
	approach with the state representations used in POMDPs and in k-order
	Markov models. Ours is the first specific formulation of the predictive
	idea that includes both stochasticity and actions (controls). We

  abstract = {It is widely believed that learning is due, at least in part, to long-lasting
	modifications of the strengths of synapses in the brain. Theoretical
	studies have shown that a family of synaptic plasticity rules, in
	which synaptic changes are driven by covariance, is particularly
	useful for many forms of learning, including associative memory,
	gradient estimation, and operant conditioning. Covariance-based plasticity
	is inherently sensitive. Even a slight mistuning of the parameters
	of a covariance-based plasticity rule is likely to result in substantial
	changes in synaptic efficacies. Therefore, the biological relevance
	of covariance-based plasticity models is questionable. Here, we study
	the effects of mistuning parameters of the plasticity rule in a decision
	making model in which synaptic plasticity is driven by the covariance
	of reward and neural activity. An exact covariance plasticity rule
	yields Herrnstein's matching law. We show that although the effect
	of slight mistuning of the plasticity rule on the synaptic efficacies
	is large, the behavioral effect is small. Thus, matching behavior
	is robust to mistuning of the parameters of the covariance-based
	plasticity rule. Furthermore, the mistuned covariance rule results
	in undermatching, which is consistent with experimentally observed
	behavior. These results substantiate the hypothesis that approximate
	covariance-based synaptic plasticity underlies operant conditioning.
	However, we show that the mistuning of the mean subtraction makes
	behavior sensitive to the mistuning of the properties of the decision
	making network. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the robustness
	of matching behavior to changes in the plasticity rule and its robustness
	to changes in the properties of the decision making network.},

  abstract = {It has previously been shown that generic cortical microcircuit models
	can perform complex real-time computations on continuous input streams,
	provided that these computations can be carried out with a rapidly
	fading memory. We investigate the computational capability of such
	circuits in the more realistic case where not only readout neurons,
	but in addition a few neurons within the circuit, have been trained
	for specific tasks. This is essentially equivalent to the case where
	the output of trained readout neurons is fed back into the circuit.
	We show that this new model overcomes the limitation of a rapidly
	fading memory. In fact, we prove that in the idealized case without
	noise it can carry out any conceivable digital or analog computation
	on time-varying inputs. But even with noise, the resulting computational
	model can perform a large class of biologically relevant real-time
	computations that require a nonfading memory. We demonstrate these
	computational implications of feedback both theoretically, and through
	computer simulations of detailed cortical microcircuit models that
	are subject to noise and have complex inherent dynamics. We show
	that the application of simple learning procedures (such as linear
	regression or perceptron learning) to a few neurons enables such
	circuits to represent time over behaviorally relevant long time spans,
	to integrate evidence from incoming spike trains over longer periods
	of time, and to process new information contained in such spike trains
	in diverse ways according to the current internal state of the circuit.
	In particular we show that such generic cortical microcircuits with
	feedback provide a new model for working memory that is consistent
	with a large set of biological constraints. Although this article
	examines primarily the computational role of feedback in circuits
	of neurons, the mathematical principles on which its analysis is
	based apply to a variety of dynamical systems. Hence they may also
	throw new light on the computational role of feedback in other complex

	neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time
	computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms
	based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not
	require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead,
	it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in
	combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented
	on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that
	the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical
	system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit
	may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can
	learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent
	neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may
	be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required
	for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be
	transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to
	the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is
	based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine,
	that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions
	between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as
	the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict
	universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for
	the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing
	of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for
	the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and

	by the dynamic coupling between the brain, the body, and the environment.
	This implies that control, which is conventionally thought to be
	handled by the brain or a controller, can partially be outsourced
	to the physical body and the interaction with the environment. This
	idea has been demonstrated in a number of recently constructed robots,
	in particular from the ?eld of ¬{\`\i}soft robotics¬{\^\i}. Soft
	robots are made of a soft material introducing high-dimensionality,
	nonlinearity, and elasticity, which often makes the robots dif?cult
	to control. Biological systems such as the octopus are mastering
	their complex bodies in highly sophisticated manners by capitalizing
	on their body dynamics. We will demonstrate that the structure of
	the octopus arm cannot only be exploited for generating behavior
	but also, in a sense, as a computational resource. By using a soft
	robotic arm inspired by the octopus we show in a number of experiments
	how control is partially incorporated into the physical arm¬{\'\i}s
	dynamics and how the arm¬{\'\i}s dynamics can be exploited to approximate
	nonlinear dynamical systems and embed nonlinear limit cycles. Future
	application scenarios as well as the implications of the results
	for the octopus biology are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a lot of interest in building anthropomorphic
	robots. Research on humanoid robotics has focused on the control
	of manipulators and walking machines. The contributions of the torso
	towards ordinary movements (such as walking, dancing, attracting
	mates, and maintaining balance) have been neglected by almost all
	humanoid robotic researchers. We believe that the next generation
	of humanoid robots will incorporate a flexible spine in the torso.
	To meet the challenge of controlling this kind of high-degree-of-freedom
	robot, a new control architecture is necessary. Inspired by the rhythmic
	movements commonly exhibited in lamprey locomotion as well as belly
	dancing, we designed a controller for a simulated belly-dancing robot
	using the lamprey central pattern generator. Experimental results
	show that the proposed lamprey central pattern generator module could
	potentially generate plausible output patterns, which could be used
	for all the possible spine motions with minimized control parameters.
	For instance, in the case of planar spine motions, only three input
	parameters are required. Using our controller, the simulated robot
	is able to perform complex torso movements commonly seen in belly
	dancing as well. Our work suggests that the proposed controller can
	potentially be a suitable controller for a high-degree-of-freedom,
	flexible spine humanoid robot. Furthermore, it allows us to gain
	a better understanding of belly dancing by synthesis.},

  title = {A Model Of Caterpillar Locomotion Based On Assur Tensegrity Structures},
  school = {Tel Aviv University},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Caterpillars are soft-bodied animals and use fluid and tissue pressure
	to stiffen their body, a mechanism known as hydrostatic skeleton.
	They have a relatively simple nervous system, but are still able
	to perform a variety of complex movements. This paper presents a
	2D caterpillar simulation which mimics caterpillar locomotion using
	Assur tensegrity structures. Tensegrity structures are structures
	composed of a discontinuous set of compressed components inside a
	continuum of tensioned components. Their stability is maintained
	by the self-equilibrated state of all elements. Assur tensegrities
	are a novel sub-group of tensegrity structures. In the model, each
	caterpillar segment is represented by a 2D tensegrity triad consisting
	of two bars connected by two cables and a strut. The two cables represent
	the two major longitudinal muscles of the caterpillar, while the
	strut represents hydrostatic skeleton. In addition to the mechanical
	structure, the control scheme in this model is also inspired by the
	biological caterpillar. The unique engineering properties of Assur
	tensegrity structures, together with the suggested control scheme,
	provide a model with simple and intuitive control. In addition, the
	model segments have a controllable degree of softness - each segment
	can be either soft or rigid. The model also exhibits several characteristics
	which are analogous to those of the biological caterpillar. One such
	characteristic is that the internal pressure of the biological caterpillar
	is not a function of its size. During growth, body mass is increased
	10,000-fold while internal pressure remains constant. In the same
	way, our model is able to use the same internal forces regardless
	of model size. Our research also suggests that caterpillars don't
	invest considerably more energy while crawling than while resting.

  abstract = {The rate of stepping in the hind legs of chronic spinal and decerebrate
	cats adapts to the speed of the treadmill on which the animals walk.
	This adaptive behavior depends on sensory signals generated near
	the end of stance phase controlling the transition from stance to
	swing. Two sensory signals have been identified to have this role:
	one from afferents activated by hip extension, most likely arising
	from muscle spindles in hip flexor muscles, and the other from group
	Ib afferents from Golgi tendon organs in the ankle extensor muscles.
	The relative importance of these two signals in controlling the stance
	to swing transition differs in chronic spinal cats and in decerebrate
	cats. Activation of hip afferents is necessary for controlling the
	transition in chronic spinal cats but not in decerebrate cats, while
	reduction in activity in group Ib afferents from GTOs is the primary
	factor controlling the transition in decerebrate cats. Possible mechanisms
	for this difference are discussed. The extent to which these two
	sensory signals control the stance to swing transition in normal
	walking cats is unknown, but it is likely that both could play an
	important role when animals are walking in a variable environment.},

	enhance perceptual and executive control processes to achieve more
	efficient goal-directed behavior. Specifically, in the context of
	cognitive tasks offering monetary gains, improved behavioral performance
	has been repeatedly observed in conjunction with elevated neural
	activations in task-relevant perceptual, cognitive and reward-related
	regions. We address the neural basis of motivation-cognition interactions
	by suggesting various modes of communication between relevant neural
	networks: (1) global hub regions may integrate information from multiple
	inputs providing a communicative link between specialized networks;
	(2) point-to-point interactions allow for more specific cross-network
	communication; and (3) diffuse neuromodulatory systems can relay
	motivational signals to cortex and enhance signal processing. Together,
	these modes of communication allow information regarding motivational

	the brain controls the body? In How the Body Shapes the Way We Think,
	Rolf Pfeifer and Josh Bongard demonstrate that thought is not independent
	of the body but is tightly constrained, and at the same time enabled,
	by it. They argue that the kinds of thoughts we are capable of have
	their foundation in our embodimentin our morphology and the material
	properties of our bodies. This crucial notion of embodiment underlies
	fundamental changes in the field of artificial intelligence over
	the past two decades, and Pfeifer and Bongard use the basic methodology
	of artificial intelligence"understanding by building"to describe
	their insights. If we understand how to design and build intelligent
	systems, they reason, we will better understand intelligence in general.
	In accessible, nontechnical language, and using many examples, they
	introduce the basic concepts by building on recent developments in
	robotics, biology, neuroscience, and psychology to outline a possible
	theory of intelligence. They illustrate applications of such a theory
	in ubiquitous computing, business and management, and the psychology
	of human memory. Embodied intelligence, as described by Pfeifer and
	Bongard, has important implications for our understanding of both
	natural and artificial intelligence.},

	centers in the thorax can support locomotion in absence of inputs
	from head ganglia. Posture, walking, and leg motor activity was examined
	in cockroaches with lesions of neck or circumoesophageal connectives.
	Early in recovery, cockroaches with neck lesions had hyper-extended
	postures and did not walk. After recovery, posture was less hyper-extended
	and animals initiated slow leg movements for multiple cycles. Neck
	lesioned individuals showed an increase in walking after injection
	of either octopamine or pilocarpine. The phase of leg movement between
	segments was reduced in neck lesioned cockroaches from that seen
	in intact animals, while phases in the same segment remained constant.
	Neither octopamine nor pilocarpine initiated changes in coordination
	between segments in neck lesioned individuals. Animals with lesions
	of the circumoesophageal connectives had postures similar to intact
	individuals but walked in a tripod gait for extended periods of time.
	Changes in activity of slow tibial extensor and coxal depressor motor
	neurons and concomitant changes in leg joint angles were present
	after the lesions. This suggests that thoracic circuits are sufficient
	to produce leg movements but coordinated walking with normal motor
	patterns requires descending input from head ganglia.},

	in the same plane, as in the human swimmer's breast stroke. The form
	of beat is like that of cilia. Occasionally cells swim backward with
	the flagella undulating and trailing the cell. Thus the same flagellar
	apparatus produces two types of motion. The central pair of fibers
	of both flagella appear to lie in the same plane, which coincides
	with the plane of beat. The two basal bodies lie in a V configuration
	and are joined at the top by a striated fiber and at the bottom by
	two smaller fibers. From the area between the basal bodies four bands
	of microtubules, each containing four tubules, radiate in an X-shaped
	pattern, diverge, and pass under the cell membrane. Details of the
	complex arrangement of tubules near the basal bodies are described.
	It seems probable that the connecting fibers and the microtubules
	play structural roles and thereby maintain the alignment of the flagellar
	apparatus. The relation of striated fibers and microtubules to cilia
	and flagella is reviewed, particularly in phytoflagellates and protozoa.
	Structures observed in the transitional region between the basal
	body and flagellar shaft are described and their occurrence is reviewed.
	Details of structure of the flagellar shaft and flagellar tip are

  abstract = {Models of dynamical systems based on pre- dictive state representations
	(PSRs) are defined strictly in terms of observable quantities, in
	contrast with traditional models (such as Hidden Markov Models) that
	use latent variables or state- space representations. In addition,
	PSRs have an effectively infinite memory, allowing them to model
	some systems that finite memory-based models cannot. Thus far, PSR
	models have primarily been developed for domains with discrete observations.
	Here, we develop the Predictive Linear-Gaussian (PLG) model, a class
	of PSR models for domains with continuous observations. We showthat
	PLG models subsume Linear Dynamical System models (also called Kalman
	filter models or state-space models) while using fewer parameters.
	We also introduce an algorithm to estimate PLG parameters from data,
	and contrast it with standard Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms
	used to estimate Kalman filter parameters. We show that our algorithm
	is a consistent estimation procedure and present preliminary empirical
	results suggesting that our algorithm outperforms EM, particularly
	as the model dimension increases.},

	The algorithm finds the eigenvectors of the input correlation matrix,
	and it is proven to converge with probability one. An implementation
	which can train neural networks using only local "synaptic" modification
	rules is described. It is shown that the algorithm is closely related
	to algorithms in statistics (Factor Analysis and Principal Components
	Analysis) and neural networks (Self-supervised Backpropagation, or
	the "encoder" problem). It thus provides an explanation of certain
	neural network behavior in terms of" classical statistical techniques.
	Examples of the use of a linear network for solving image coding

	process and achieve a high dropping efficiency. We operate the CDFs
	in two modes; one requires careful control of the interference process,

  abstract = {In experiments designed to uncover the neural basis of adaptive decision
	making in a foraging environment, neuroscientists have reported single-cell
	activities in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) that are correlated
	with choice options and their subjective values. To investigate the
	underlying synaptic mechanism, we considered a spiking neuron model
	of decision making endowed with synaptic plasticity that follows
	a reward-dependent stochastic Hebbian learning rule. This general
	model is tested in a matching task in which rewards on two targets
	are scheduled randomly with different rates. Our main results are
	threefold. First, we show that plastic synapses provide a natural
	way to integrate past rewards and estimate the local (in time) "return"
	of a choice. Second, our model reproduces the matching behavior (i.e.,
	the proportional allocation of choices matches the relative reinforcement
	obtained on those choices, which is achieved through melioration
	in individual trials). Our model also explains the observed "undermatching"
	phenomenon and points to biophysical constraints (such as finite
	learning rate and stochastic neuronal firing) that set the limits
	to matching behavior. Third, although our decision model is an attractor
	network exhibiting winner-take-all competition, it captures graded
	neural spiking activities observed in LIP, when the latter were sorted
	according to the choices and the difference in the returns for the
	two targets. These results suggest that neurons in LIP are involved
	in selecting the oculomotor responses, whereas rewards are integrated
	and stored elsewhere, possibly by plastic synapses and in the form
	of the return rather than income of choice options.},

	Using this approach, we construct networks that produce a wide variety

	and motor patterns matching human motion capture data. Our results
	reproduce data on premovement activity in motor and premotor cortex,

	using dynamical systems language based on the results of our robot
	learning experiments. A neural network model consisting of multiple
	modules is proposed, in which the interactive dynamics between the
	bottom-up perception and the top-down prediction are investigated.
	Our experiments with a real mobile robot showed that the incremental
	learning of the robot switches spontaneously between steady and unsteady
	phases. In the steady phase, the top-down prediction for the bottom-up
	perception works well when coherence is achieved between the internal
	and the environmental dynamics. In the unsteady phase, conflicts
	arise between the bottom-up perception and the top-down prediction;
	the coherence is lost, and a chaotic attractor is observed in the
	internal neural dynamics. By investigating possible analogies between
	this result and the phenomenological literature on the &#145;self&#039;,
	we draw the conclusions that (1) the structure of the &#145;self&#146;
	corresponds to the &#145;open dynamic structure&#146; which is characterized
	by co-existence of stability in terms of goal-directedness and instability

  abstract = {Bacterial flagella are filamentous organelles that drive cell locomotion.
	They thrust cells in liquids (swimming) or on surfaces (swarming)
	so that cells can move toward favorable environments. At the base
	of each flagellum, a reversible rotary motor, which is powered by
	the proton- or the sodium-motive force, is embedded in the cell envelope.
	The motor consists of two parts: the rotating part, or rotor, that
	is connected to the hook and the filament, and the nonrotating part,
	or stator, that conducts coupling ion and is responsible for energy
	conversion. Intensive genetic and biochemical studies of the flagellum
	have been conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli,
	and more than 50 gene products are known to be involved in flagellar
	assembly and function. The energy-coupling mechanism, however, is
	still not known. In this chapter, we survey our current knowledge
	of the flagellar system, based mostly on studies from Salmonella,
	E. coli, and marine species Vibrio alginolyticus, supplemented with
	distinct aspects of other bacterial species revealed by recent studies.},

	under a wide range of environmental conditions. Recent studies have
	demonstrated that numerous species possess a single flagellar system

	production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension
	to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius
	and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically
	changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor
	digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver
	fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal
	interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions
	in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to
	the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic
	gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities.
	Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon
	networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching
	behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich
	repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon
	paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon
	network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be
	critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular
	control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic
	scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural "somatic

  abstract = {Reservoir computing (RC), a computational paradigm inspired on neural
	systems, has become increasingly popular in recent years for solving
	a variety of complex recognition and classification problems. Thus
	far, most implementations have been software-based, limiting their
	speed and power efficiency. Integrated photonics offers the potential
	for a fast, power efficient and massively parallel hardware implementation.
	We have previously proposed a network of coupled semiconductor optical
	amplifiers as an interesting test case for such a hardware implementation.
	In this paper, we investigate the important design parameters and
	the consequences of process variations through simulations. We use
	an isolated word recognition task with babble noise to evaluate the
	performance of the photonic reservoirs with respect to traditional
	software reservoir implementations, which are based on leaky hyperbolic
	tangent functions. Our results show that the use of coherent light
	in a well-tuned reservoir architecture offers significant performance
	benefits. The most important design parameters are the delay and
	the phase shift in the system's physical connections. With optimized
	values for these parameters, coherent semiconductor optical amplifier
	(SOA) reservoirs can achieve better results than traditional simulated
	reservoirs. We also show that process variations hardly degrade the
	performance, but amplifier noise can be detrimental. This effect
	must therefore be taken into account when designing SOA-based RC

  abstract = {The Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a recently developed computational
	model with interesting properties. It can be used for pattern classification,
	function approximation and other complex tasks. Contrary to most
	common computational models, the LSM does not require information
	to be stored in some stable state of the system: the inherent dynamics
	of the system are used by a memoryless readout function to compute
	the output. In this paper we present a case study of the performance
	of the Liquid State Machine based on a recurrent spiking neural network
	by applying it to a well known and well studied problem: speech recognition
	of isolated digits. We evaluate different ways of coding the speech
	into spike trains. In its optimal configuration, the performance
	of the LSM approximates that of a state-of-the-art recognition system.
	Another interesting conclusion is the fact that the biologically
	most realistic encoding performs far better than more conventional
	methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	mechanical continuum, porous filament gel, tensed cortical membrane,
	or tensegrity network that maintains a stabilizing prestress through
	incorporation of discrete structural elements that bear compression.
	Real-time microscopic analysis of cells containing GFP-labeled microtubules
	and associated mitochondria revealed that living cells behave like
	discrete structures composed of an interconnected network of actin
	microfilaments and microtubules when mechanical stresses are applied
	to cell surface integrin receptors. Quantitation of cell tractional
	forces and cellular prestress by using traction force microscopy
	confirmed that microtubules bear compression and are responsible
	for a significant portion of the cytoskeletal prestress that determines
	cell shape stability under conditions in which myosin light chain
	phosphorylation and intracellular calcium remained unchanged. Quantitative
	measurements of both static and dynamic mechanical behaviors in cells
	also were consistent with specific a priori predictions of the tensegrity
	model. These findings suggest that tensegrity represents a unified
	model of cell mechanics that may help to explain how mechanical behaviors
	emerge through collective interactions among different cytoskeletal
	filaments and extracellular adhesions in living cells.},

	of stepping, J. Neur. Psychopathol. 3, 112-116. Only in recent years,
	however, have the mechanisms been analyzed in detail. Quite a few
	of these mechanisms have been described using the decerebrate cat.
	Locomotion is initiated in decerebrate cats by activation of the
	mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) that activates the medial medullary
	reticular formation (MRF) which in turn projects axons to the spinal
	cord which descend within the ventrolateral funiculus (VLF). The
	MRF region regulates as well as initiates the stepping pattern and
	is thought to be involved in interlimb coordination. Afferent feedback
	from proprioceptors and exteroceptors can modify the ongoing locomotor
	pattern. Recently, the types of afferents responsible for signaling
	the stance to swing transition have been identified. A general rule
	states that if the limb is unloaded and the leg is extended, then
	swing will occur. The afferents that detect unloading of the limb
	are the Golgi tendon organs and stimulation of these afferents (at
	group I strengths) prolongs the stance phase in walking cats. The
	afferents that detect the extension of the leg have been found to
	be the length- and velocity-sensitive muscle afferents located in
	flexor muscles. Plasticity of locomotor systems is discussed briefly
	in this article. Descerebrate animals can adapt locomotor behaviors
	to respond to new environmental conditions. Oligosynaptic reflex
	pathways that control locomotion can be recalibrated after injury
	in a manner that appears to be functionally related to the recovery
	of the animal.},

	Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially
	true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range

	of nanostructures. DNA, in particular, shows great potential to be
	a superb molecular system. Synthetic DNA molecules have been programmed
	to assemble into a wide range of nanostructures. It is generally
	believed that rigidities of DNA nanomotifs (tiles) are essential
	for programmable self-assembly of well defined nanostructures. Recently,
	we have shown that adequate conformational flexibility could be exploited
	for assembling 3D objects, including tetrahedra, dodecahedra, and
	buckyballs, out of DNA three-point star motifs. In the current study,
	we have integrated tensegrity principle into this concept to assemble
	well defined, complex nanostructures in both 2D and 3D. A symmetric
	five-point-star motif (tile) has been designed to assemble into icosahedra
	or large nanocages depending on the concentration and flexibility
	of the DNA tiles. In both cases, the DNA tiles exhibit significant
	flexibilities and undergo substantial conformational changes, either
	symmetrically bending out of the plane or asymmetrically bending
	in the plane. In contrast to the complicated natures of the assembled
	structures, the approach presented here is simple and only requires
	three different component DNA strands. These results demonstrate
	that conformational flexibility could be explored to generate complex
	DNA nanostructures. The basic concept might be further extended to
	other biomacromolecular systems, such as RNA and proteins.},

  abstract = {The potential applications of tensegrity structures are not only increasing
	in civil engineering but also in fields like biomechanics. The key
	step in designing tensegrity, the form-finding problem, has been
	investigated by many researchers but until now they have tended to
	focus on methods for regular shapes. Since there is an increasing
	need for design tools devoted to more various and complex systems,
	the objective of this paper is to present the form-finding of nonregular
	tensegrity structures with a numerical approach. It is based on the
	dynamic relaxation method with kinetic damping, and new tensegrity
	configurations in more intricate and creative forms can be obtained
	this way. During the form-finding process, either the force or length
	of some elements can be fixed by an appropriate choice of related
	stiffnesses. The application of the process is illustrated by several
	numerical examples. It can be concluded that an improvement in tensegrity
	form-finding has been achieved extending research from regular shapes
	toward "freer" shapes.},
